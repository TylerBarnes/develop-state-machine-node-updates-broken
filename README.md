This is a minimal reproduction of a `gatsby develop` state machine bug where calling and awaiting createNode from within a nested function never resolves. In this example, it's not disruptive, but in other cases this may be a problem. For example in the WP experimental source plugin, createNode was being awaited in order to log a success message afterwards and then restart the delta checker. This bug meant that the message would never display and the checker wouldn't restart after the first update. To fix that in the WP plugin I just stopped awaiting createNode, but surfacing this here in case this affects other plugins.
